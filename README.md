## üìù About Stream

You can sign up for a Stream account at our [Get Started](https://getstream.io/chat/get_started/) page.

This library can be used by both frontend and backend applications. For frontend, we have frameworks that are based on this library such as the [Flutter](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-flutter), [React](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react) and [Angular](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-angular) SDKs. For more information, check out our [docs](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm install stream-chat
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add stream-chat
```

### JS deliver

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stream-chat"></script>
```

## ‚ú® Getting started

The StreamChat client is setup to allow extension of the base types through use of generics when instantiated. The default instantiation has all generics set to `Record<string, unknown>`.

```typescript
import { StreamChat } from 'stream-chat';
// Or if you are on commonjs
const StreamChat = require('stream-chat').StreamChat;

const client = StreamChat.getInstance('YOUR_API_KEY', 'API_KEY_SECRET');

const channel = client.channel('messaging', 'TestChannel');
await channel.create();
```

Or you can customize the generics:

```typescript
type ChatChannel = { image: string; category?: string };
type ChatUser1 = { nickname: string; age: number; admin?: boolean };
type ChatUser2 = { nickname: string; avatar?: string };
type UserMessage = { country?: string };
type AdminMessage = { priorityLevel: number };
type ChatAttachment = { originalURL?: string };
type CustomReaction = { size?: number };
type ChatEvent = { quitChannel?: boolean };
type CustomCommands = 'giphy';

type StreamType = {
  attachmentType: ChatAttachment;
  channelType: ChatChannel;
  commandType: CustomCommands;
  eventType: ChatEvent;
  messageType: UserMessage | AdminMessage;
  reactionType: CustomReaction;
  userType: ChatUser1 | ChatUser2;
};

const client = StreamChat.getInstance<StreamType>('YOUR_API_KEY', 'API_KEY_SECRET');

// Create channel
const channel = client.channel('messaging', 'TestChannel');
await channel.create();

// Create user
await client.upsertUser({
  id: 'vishal-1',
  name: 'Vishal',
});

// Send message
const { message } = await channel.sendMessage({ text: `Test message` });

// Send reaction
await channel.sendReaction(message.id, { type: 'love', user: { id: 'vishal-1' } });
```

Custom types provided when initializing the client will carry through to all client returns and provide intellisense to queries.
