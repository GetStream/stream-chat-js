# CHANGELOG

## September 15, 2021 - 4.2.0

### Fixes

- Fixed the behavior of `isConnecting` flag in `StableWSConnection` class. Also `client.connecting` flag has been removed, so this could potentially be a breaking change for you, although this flag was never properly set so ideally you shouldn't be using
  this flag. [bb165f8](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/commit/bb165f8c48a140c06c6811a337955cd5258877f9)

### Features

- Added option `clear_deleted_message_text` in `exportChannels` endpoint [33f627f](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/commit/33f627f0f8b8b669d463b5393ec93a37f53d6415)

## Augest 24, 2021 - 4.1.0

### Feature

- Add `own_capabilities` attribute to channel response data #741
- Add `team` filter for query flagged messages #754
- `queryChannel` support `user_id` for server-side queries #753

### Fix

- Campaign namespace update #760

## Augest 12, 2021 - 4.0.0

### Breaking ⚠️

From now on `client.connectUser()` should be awaited #747. All instances of `connectUser()` should be changed to:

```js
await connectUser();
// or
connectUser().then();
// ....
// queryChannels and other methods should be called after promosie is resolved
```

The behavior is now improved for poor connections and `connectUser` retries to establish the connection before throwing an error. Make sure to handle the failure gracefully and do not proceed to query channels or other methods until `connectUser` resolves.

### Feature

- Campaign feature flag, name and description added #745 #736
- Campaign and Segment pagination option #737
- `queryChannels` options to skip initialization of certain channels #743 #740

- Reverting [c5413c0](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/commit/c5413c07e6743e056b04ade7ccacebeb0f2b1b4f)

  Commit description: Avoid duplication of reaction, by adding check for existing reaction

  Reason:

  1. latest_reactions only contain 10 reactions. So the added check is not sufficient.
  2. It will need handle remove reactions as well.
  3. own_reactions doesn't contain user object always. So that use case will need handling as well.
